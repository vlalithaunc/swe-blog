Knowledge: This involves representing information from a problem and making logical inferences from it. 


Uncertainty: This concept deals with handling unpredicatble events using probability and statistical methods.

Optimization: This concept focuses on finding the most efficient solution among all the possible solutions. 

Learning: Improving performance by learning from data and experience, like how your email filters out spam.

Neural Networks: A type of AI inspired by the human brain, great for tasks like image and speech recognition.
